## PythonAI_Face_Detector

A face detector app that detects faces in real time, built using Python and the OpenCV library.
The app will first open an image to show the format of the rectangular boxes which will be used to detect and point out faces.
It'll then open the webcam on the local device to detect the faces before it. The window can be closed by pressing the "Q/q" key on the keyboard.
Uses the Haar Cascade algorithm.
